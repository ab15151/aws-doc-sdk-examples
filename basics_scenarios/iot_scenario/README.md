# AWS IoT Getting Started Scenario

## Introduction
This Java-based AWS IoT program demonstrates a getting started scenario for interacting with the AWS IoT Core service. The program guides you through a series of steps, including creating an IoT Thing, generating a device certificate, updating the Thing with attributes, and performing various other operations. It utilizes the AWS SDK for Java V2 and showcases the functionality for managing IoT Things, certificates, rules, shadows, and performing searches. Furthermore, this example covers a wide range of functionality for new users of the Java SDK and AWS IoT Core service.

## User Interaction
The program prompts the user for input at various stages, allowing them to customize the scenario to their specific needs. The user is asked to provide the following information:

1. **Thing Name**: The name of the IoT Thing to be created.
2. **Certificate Creation**: The user can choose to create a device certificate for the IoT Thing.
3. **Thing Attribute Update**: The user can update the IoT Thing with new attributes.
4. **Rule Creation**: The user is prompted to provide a rule name and an SNS action ARN for creating a new IoT rule.
5. **Certificate Deletion**: The user can choose to detach and delete the previously created device certificate.
6. **Thing Deletion**: The user can choose to delete the IoT Thing.

Throughout the workflow, the program provides detailed explanations and prompts the user to press Enter to continue, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

## Service Operations Invoked
The program interacts with the following AWS IoT service operations:

1. **createThing**: Creates a new IoT Thing in the AWS IoT Core service.
2. **createKeysAndCertificate**: Generates a new device certificate and its associated private key.
3. **attachThingPrincipal**: Attaches the generated device certificate to the IoT Thing.
4. **updateThingShadow**: Updates the IoT Thing with new attributes.
5. **describeEndpoint**: Retrieves the unique endpoint specific to the user's AWS account.
6. **listCertificates**: Lists the user's existing IoT certificates.
7. **updateThingShadow**: Updates the digital representation (shadow) of the IoT Thing.
8. **getThingShadow**: Retrieves the state information of the IoT Thing's shadow in JSON format.
9. **createTopicRule**: Creates a new rule that triggers an SNS action based on a SQL query.
10. **listTopicRules**: Lists the user's existing IoT rules.
11. **searchIndex**: Performs a search for IoT Things based on the provided query string.
12. **detachThingPrincipal**: Detaches the device certificate from the IoT Thing.
13. **deleteCertificate**: Deletes the previously created device certificate.
14. **deleteThing**: Deletes the IoT Thing.

The program demonstrates the comprehensive capabilities of the AWS IoT Core service and showcases how to integrate these various operations using the AWS SDK for Java V2.
